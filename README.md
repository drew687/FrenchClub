Our group consist of Nicolas Glosson, Andrew Mayo, and , Justin Thomas and our group is called N.D.J. and we attend Maddison Academic High-School.

We worked on different parts of the website, Drew worked on the responsiveness of the website, Nic put in the information of the website, and Justin gathered the information for the website from Dr. Spires.

We asked Dr. Spires if we could make a website for the French Club because we notice that on her main website that she does have a page for the French Club but it does not have that much information about the French Club. So we decided that we could make her own website just for the French Club and have information far the website.
